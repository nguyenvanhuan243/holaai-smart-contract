New features on an updated version
- All handled in smart contracts
Pumpfun uses backend client code to fetch buy transaction and create raydium pool.
I've handled all that parts on smart contract to enhance the security and availability.

- Added some launch phases
There's some phases to launch a token like `Presale`.
If the users want to snipe a token, they can bid for the token in `Presale` phase before `Launch`.

- Raydium/Meteora
Token launchers can migrate their tokens to Raydium or Migrate as their wish after the curve is completed.
